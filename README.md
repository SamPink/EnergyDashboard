## Project Overview

The Real-Time Energy Market Analysis Dashboard aims to provide real-time insights and analysis on various energy markets by blending data from various public APIs, web scraping, and advanced analytics, possibly powered by GPT-4 for predictive insights or natural language summaries.

## Data Acquisition and Management

### Web Scraping and API Interactions
- Utilize Python libraries to interact with public APIs and web scrape real-time data from relevant energy market sources.

### ETL Pipelines
- Build ETL pipelines using Python to clean, transform, and load data into a PostgreSQL data warehouse utilizing SQLAlchemy for ORM.

### Cloud Deployment
- Deploy the data warehouse on AWS or GCP to ensure high availability and scalability.

### Data Governance
- Implement data governance practices to ensure data quality and consistency across the platform.

## Data Processing and Analysis

### Real-Time Data Processing
- Utilize Airflow for scheduling and orchestrating real-time data processing tasks.

### Advanced Analytics
- Implement GPT-4 powered analytics to provide predictive insights on market trends based on historical and real-time data.

### Data Modeling
- Create models for forecasting and trend analysis to provide actionable insights to users.

## Dashboard Development and Deployment

### Interactive Dashboard
- Build an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to visualize real-time data and GPT-4 powered insights.

### Containerization
- Containerize the dashboard application using Docker to ensure consistent deployment and scalability.

### Cloud Deployment
